// Regex that matches `/assets/<path>.<ext>` URLs we want to cache-bust.

// Notes:
// - The non-capturing group `(?:...)` is intentional. The previous version in
//   `xpack/hooks/transform.ts` used `(:?...)` which is a bug — it matches a
//   literal `:` optionally and then the alternation. The replacement still
//   "worked" because we use the full match `s`, but the regex was wrong.
// - Trailing `\??` accepts an already-present `?` so we can detect (and skip)
//   URLs that already carry a query string in the replacer below.
// - Extensions cover the union of what CSS and JS/TS modules can reference:
//   fonts (ttf/otf/woff/woff2), raster images (png/webp/jpg/jpeg/gif) and
//   vector images (svg). `fig` from the legacy regex was almost certainly a
//   typo for `gif` and is intentionally not carried over.
